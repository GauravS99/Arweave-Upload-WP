# Arweave-Upload-WP
A Wordpress plugin that allows the user to upload their Arweave keyfile (JSON), and back up every published Wordpress post to the Arweave. It is thus backed up to the permanent web.

NOTE: Uninstalling the plugin will remove the transaction data from the Wordpress database. This means you will not be able to find
the arweave transaction ID associated with each post backed up on the Arweave. Make sure to save the transaction IDs
somewhere if you want to find them in the future.
